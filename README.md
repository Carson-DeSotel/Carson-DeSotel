## About:
I am currently a Software Engineer at Optum. I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a B.A. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Geography as a member of the class of 2022. 

I think of myself as a bit of a full-stack engineer, though I prefer to work on the backend. I enjoy coming up with algorithms and data structures to solve problems as I go. I'm a strong believe in code as an art and will push for beautiful code alongside working, efficient code. Programming is an art meant to be seen by people, if people can't read it, you've done it wrong. 

I love listening to music, reading, cooking, and playing games of all sorts. Send any recommendations my way!
