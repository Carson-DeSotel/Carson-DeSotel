## About:
Heya, welcome to my page! My name's Carson DeSotel, I'm a senior at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities where I study Computer Science and Geography. I find myself very interested in learning more about databases, data structures, geographic information systems, and urban design. I hope to be able to blend all my interests together in a way that allows me to create a better world for us all to live in.
