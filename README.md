## About:
Heya, welcome to my page! My name's Carson DeSotel, I'm a junior at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities where I study Computer Science and Geography. I find myself very interested in learning more about databases, data structures, geographic information systems, and urban design. I hope to be able to blend all my interests together in a way that allows me to create a better world for us all to live in. 

## My GitHub:
My GitHub page has mainly been used to host personal projects, mainly programming, but also some more text-based documents like some essays and my resume which have been made using LaTeX. I hope to create more fleshed-out, finished projects soon! Besides programming, I'd like to use this to share and track mapping assignments that I create using ArcGIS. Hopefully we can see more of that this year!
